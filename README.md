# Mamud_Final_Year_Project (CMP6200 Individual Honours Project A AYR 2025/6)

# Introduction
This project explores new forms of game interaction by developing a custom controller that will support motion control using Arduino Hardware. Instead of relying on traditional keyboard or joystick inputs, the controller uses motion sensing technology to aim within a shooter game environment, while physical buttons enable actions such as shooting. 

The purpose of this study is to investigate whether alternative game controllers can:

* Improve accessibility
* Enchance Immersion
* Introduce new creative ways to interact with games

# Objectives and Motivation

# Research 
* Researching player experience with alternative game controllers
* Understanding benefits for accessibility and engagement
* Comparing traditional vs non traditional controllers

# Development
* Building a fully functional scene within Unity that supports a custom built motion based inpuit device
* Building a custom controller using Arduino Kits
*  Conduct user testing

I believe that not all players can or want to use standard controllers, and that a new form of controller can transform how games are played.

# Technology and Tools

* Arduino Kit (motion sensors and buttons)
* Unity Engine for game development
* C# - Development of scripts
* GitHub (for kanban and workflow)

# Game and Controller summary

Motion Controller
* Tracks orientation to aim a weapon in game
* Button inputs trigger firing and interactions
* Designed to feel like a handheld pointing device

Game prototype
* Shooter game with motion based aiming
* Basic enemy targets for testing accuracy + responsiveness
* Captures gameplay metrics for evaluation

* Testing
* Controller prototype
* Unity intergration and input mapping
* Play testing + iterative improvements

# Project Management

* Weekly supervisor meetings to review design, technicaly challenges and scope
* GitHub Kanban board used to track milestones and tasks

# Supervisor Feedback

* Several meetings with my supervisor going over ideas and keep track of the project time to ensure the best quality. 

* Created a Kanban in GitHub which allows for easy schedule of my workflow also so the supervisor can keep track of where i am.

* Completed the CMP/DIG6200 Interim Project Report on the 3rd November 2025.
